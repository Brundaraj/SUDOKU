# SUDOKU
This C++ code is a Sudoku game that generates puzzles, allows solving, and tracks high scores. It provides difficulty selection, puzzle display, user input, validity checks, and time tracking. High scores are saved and can be viewed later.
The txt file named highscores.txt has to be created in the same directory as the main file for storing the highscores.
